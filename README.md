# OzhekWeatherBot

This is my first Telegram bot. Using PythonTelegramBotApi and openweathermap.org api .
The main idea is to get current weather information from source and display it.
Other features will be added later, for now it is language(by default is english, can be changed) and shortcuts(adding, removing) for fast typing.
We have a database where listed users, language they use, and cities that they added for shortcut.
